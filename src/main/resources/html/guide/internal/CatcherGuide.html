<p>Catcher allows you to manually intercept ("catch") and edit PDUs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Catcher GUI Tab is added to PETEP when you press start. Catching is disabled by default and can be enabled in the Catcher tab.</p>
<h3>Section PDU Flow</h3>
<p>PDU Flow section contains fields that characterize:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Proxy</strong>: proxy instance for PDU transmission.</li>
	<li><strong>Connection</strong>: connection of specified proxy that will send the PDU to its destination.</li>
	<li><strong>Destination</strong>: in which direction the PDU is sent.</li>
	<li><strong>Target Interceptor</strong>: next interceptor in which the PDU will be processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is disabled by default, because it is an advanced approach to modify these fields.</p>
<h3>Section PDU Data</h3>
<p>PDU Data section contains fields for tags, data bytes and also protocol-specific data (if there are any).</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>
In order to specify, which PDUs should be catched, you can tag them using the following tags (all PDUs are catched by default):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>no_catch</strong>: tagged PDU won't show in GUI, however, it will be kept in queue to keep correct PDU order.</li>
	<li><strong>no_catch_skip</strong>: tagged won't be catched (it will jump over the Catcher = PDU order can be violated).</li>
	<li><strong>catch</strong>: tagged PDU will be catched even if it already has no_catch / no_catch_skip tag.</li>
</ul>
