	History is an extension that persists all intercepted PDUs to database. You can easily look at all persisted PDUs or send them to other extension using right click.

	History can be used in extensions, so you will see the history view in extensions like Repeater.

<h2>Special tags</h2>
<p>
	In order to specify, which PDUs should be persisted, you can tag them using the following tags (all PDUs are persisted by default):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>no_history</strong> - tagged PDU won't be persisted</li>
	<li><strong>history</strong> - tagged PDU will be persisted even if it already has no_history tag.</li>
</ul>
